## Dataset
DigestPath 2019:
https://digestpath2019.grand-challenge.org/Dataset/

Colorectal dataset (contributed by this paper):contains 4198 microscopy images, which are distributed as follows: adenoma, polyp, adenocarcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and neuroendocrine tumor

## Envs
- Pytorch 1.0

## Training
```
$ cd code/
# train label noise dataset and record training history
$ python iter_train.py --cached_data_file='pickle_data/digest_20.p'
# uncomment "detect label noise" code block in iter_train.py and apply label noise detect algorithm
$ python iter_train.py 
# label correction
$ python pre_iter.py
# train neural network on processed label noise dataset (apply different loss functions)
$ python train.py
# co-teaching training
$ python co-teaching.py
```
